# Programming Task 1

Given a file listing all the edges of a graph with the header:

- "Vertex1"
- "Vertex2"
- "edge_weight"
- "edge_id"

1. Compute the matrix A representing the adjacency matrix of the graph; output matrix A on a new file.
2. Compute the table T for the tabular form of the graphs representation by adjacency lists. Output table T on a new file.

- Note: before entering the file, the user is asked whether the graph is
  directed or not, i.e., the program should work for both directed and un-
  directed graphs, as specified by the user
