# Programming Task 2

- The user is required to introduce the name of a (tab-separated - .tsf) file listing all the edges of an graph, and whether the graph is directed or not;
  the file will have the header:
  - "Vertex1"
  - "Vertex2"
  - "edge_weight"
  - "edge_id"

The program will first output the list of nodes of the graph, and then
will ask for a pair of nodes, (u,v), to compute the minimum
weighted path, and the maximum weighted path, respectively,
between u and v; the program will display both the paths and their
weights. Then, the user will be asked whether to continue with a
new pair of nodes (y/n), and the program will continue accordingly.
