- Find a minimum spanning tree for every connected component from
  the graph

- INPUT: list of undirected non-negative weighted edges in CSV table.
- OUTPUT: a comma-separated list of edge labels forming the spanning
  tree
- The total weight of the minimal spanning tree is 395.

- Note that in general a graph may have more than one minimal-weight spanning tree
