- Find a proper edge and vertex coloring for an undirected graph; colors could be represented as integers.
- INPUT: list of undirected non-negative weighted edges in CSV table.
- OUTPUT: 2 CSV tables:

1. vertex-coloring (columns: vertex-id,vertex-color);
2. edge-coloring (columns: edge-id, edge-color)
