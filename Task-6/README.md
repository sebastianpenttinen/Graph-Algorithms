# Programming Task 6

- Find a maximum flow in a given network. Use the Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm.
- INPUT: list of directed edges and their capacities in CSV table, the source and the sink vertex. The format of CSV table: Vertex1, Vertex2, capacity, id.
- OUTPUT: CSV table with flow value assigned to each edge and the max-flow value. The format of the CSV table: edge_id, flow_value
- The maxflow for the graph is: 12; SRC:n45, SINK:n52
